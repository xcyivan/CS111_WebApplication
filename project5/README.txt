Project 5: 

For project 5, we extend project 4 to allow users to buy an item with credit card info. We enable SSL on tomcat and keep information through a sequence of pages by using http session. 


    Q1: For which communication(s) do you use the SSL encryption? If you are encrypting the communication from (1) to (2) in Figure 2, for example, write (1)â†’(2) in your answer.

We use SSL encryption for 4->5 and 5->6. 


    Q2: How do you ensure that the item was purchased exactly at the Buy_Price of that particular item?

We create a session at 1, and have a map that maps the item ID to name and price. From 1 to 6, when we want to retrieve for item buy price, we ask from the map, which is consistent throughout the session.
